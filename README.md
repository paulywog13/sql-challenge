# sql-challenge

The goal of this challenge was to use SQL coding in order to analyze individual employee data using multiple data files including salaries, titles, and department information to find specific details about employees and ways to merge the data.

Files included in this challenge: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv, dept_manager.csv

Dependencies used: SQL

My schema and queries SQL files are included in the EmplyeeSQL file.

My main takeaway from this project is that SQL is a wonderful tool for finding ways to combine multiple data files using primary and foreign keys and shared information to analyze the data available. SQL allowed me to create easy to use coding options in order to combine and summarize the data in a concise, easy to read format.

The most difficult challenge I had with this assignment was in the identifying the primary and foreign keys for each table and then creating the ERD file based upon these keys.

Overall, I found this homework challenge to be fun and I enjoy the SQL coding syntax as it seems to be fairly straightforward and logical.
